We compile a Haskell file by first running 'ghci' into the terminal

We then run ':l [file name]'
This compiles the file

':r' compiles the previously compiled file


-- for comments
/= -> doesn't equal

if statemnts  -> if ......... then ............ else
(you must have an else)
Instead of if statments you can use guards: | case1 = outcome1 | case2 = outcome2 | otherwise = outcome3

functions -> "func x y =" names the function (func) and its inputs (x, y)
"func' x y =" allows you to make another version of the function (func')
